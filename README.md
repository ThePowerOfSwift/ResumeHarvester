# Resume Harvester

This application is demonstrating AVFoundation and AVKit video capture and rectangle detection features.

## Technical notes

Project is build on newest and greatest Swift (2.1) and Xcode (7.2).
CocoaPods are used for managing 3rd party dependencies, remember to open .xcworkspace instead of project.

It uses R.swift for type-safe segue and view controller identifiers.

## Acknowledgements

Learning APIs for video capture is real pain, made easier by material available on internets:
